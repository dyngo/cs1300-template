      Adolescent Andrew is a freshman in high school who is new to reheating his meals at Zoom High. Because of his 
      <br>tight zoom schedule, he often needs to reheat his food
      quickly and get back to the call. 
      <br>
      <br>
      He often tries to use the preset heating buttons such as "pizza" on the microwave, but most of the times it <br>
      overheats or underheats his pizza. He also tends to forget his food in the microwave because the alarm only goes <br>
      off twice. He has his headphones on so it is easy for him to get lost in lecture, resulting in attempting to reheat all over.
      <br>
      <br>
      This persona is a good representative of individuals who are new to reheating food with this microwave. He also is a good<br>
      example of any individual who is busy and needs to do something while the microwave is heating. This will make the user <br>
      angry if more time is needed than necessary.

      Mother Mary is middle aged mom who has several kids and is trying to balance work. Now that they are all home for zoom calling <br>
      She has to heat all their food while getting ready for work.
      <br>
      <br>
      She is a little more picky than her son when it comes to reheating food and would like to perfectly heat all components of her meal<br>
      She also is very busy and has no time to be confused by the many buttons on the interface. With her children changing the power settings<br>
      and no display of the power level, she often messes up her input time and over/underheats her food.
      <br>
      <br>
      Mother Mary is great to represent the users that are a little bit more experienced and would like a little more from the interface.<br>
      She is also representative of users who are in a rush and have other things to do while heating food, especially in the morning.<br>
      A unique role she has is that she must heat up food for all of her children and herself.
